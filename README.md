# starter-react4xp

React4xp starter, beta version 0.2.3, for Enonic **XP7**, with examples.

---

## Quick overview

This branch, `examples`, contains the example code from [the documentation](https://developer.enonic.com/templates/react4xp). Shortcut: the [site/parts/](https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp/tree/examples/src/main/resources/site/parts) and [webapp/](https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp/tree/examples/src/main/resources/webapp) folders.

Also includes the starter itself - the building blocks for client- and serverside React support in Enonic XP: a build setup with [a library](https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp) and a few [companion NPM packages](https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp#npm-package-overview). This compiles and serves JSX-format React components from Enonic XP 7.

For a clean starter without these examples, see the [master](https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp) branch or look for the react starter on [Enonic Market](https://market.enonic.com).
